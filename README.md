Numbers-Relation
================
A JAVA project to find relations between numbers. 


For example:
imagine we have a NFC card and this card has 14 different fields and everytime we use it, it will change some value on it.
What we have to do if we want to find relations between this numbers and modify it for our selves?
We can collect a few cards that are similar and enter their values into a DB and use this project to guess relations between numbers.

This project for now is only checking fixed characters if another character is in another field. But i appreciate you if you can join me to make it better.
Please let me know your ideas for adding to this projects and Fork it. :)

<-- IT IS IN DEVELOPMENT STAGE RIGHT NOW AND YOU CANNOT EXPECT IT TO WORK -->
